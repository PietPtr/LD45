## World

### Ships
Ships are usually oldfashioned styled spacecraft or stations, with modern A.I. installed. The AI is sentient and therefore respected, yet gains from living with humans since they posses more creativity. Ships can have names, but generally do not care for them much and do not mind if humans living with them provide their names.

### People
People living in orbit around Mars are generally simply surviving these conditions and are either researchers, adventurers, pilots, or children of any of these. They live on hardware sent to them from earth for the past years. They do as they please, resolving disputes with the small amount of humans personally, not needing central government.

### Mars Orbit
Around Mars there are loads of ships and stations flying around. To keep everything safe all pilot/ship combinations need licenses. The better the license the closer you are allowed to fly to the planet. This is because the closer you get to the planet the higher the speeds involved get.

### Brainlinking
Links a ship and a human, accelerating the humans thinking speed, making time seem to pass more slowly, and giving them (partial) access to ship navigation systems.

### The Ship
The ship is equipped with a simple living space, namely a computer and a sleeping bed, some plants, 3 books: intro to brainlinking, ship systems, and a logbook of the previous owner that can be added to, and some storage capability.

## Places
These places need names

### Starter station

### Trico Fuel Depot
A fuel depot owned and run by the Trico Company, run by a lonely mind who likes to battle with visiting customers. The depot does not contain any human living space.

### Fokker Station
A regular 'hub' station in a circular orbit about 500km above the surface. The station has a lot of visiting travellers who come to rest. It used to be used as a surface access point, but now the traffic has quited down quite a bit (vergane glorie). The station mind battles together with an inhabitant who's lived on fokker station nearly all his adult life, Captain $naam.

The station is shaped as a 3 dimensional plus. The radial out arm is longer than the rest of the station and contains docking ports for visiting ships. In the retrograde arm there are farms. To facilitate power to these farms the large solar arrays are attached directly to this arm. The prograde arm contains shops. The normal and anti-normal arm are home to locked living quarters of permanent inhabitants. In the radial-in arm (with the best view of the planet below) are the station mind and the captains quarters.

In the farms we find a farmer who has docked his own ship (with another small farm) permanently to the station and who wants to battle.

In the docking portion we find 3 empty ports where occasionally people visit. Here the player could simply dock their ship, wait (or sleep, or accelerate), until visitors arrive and battle them, so they can train this way.

## Place ideas

- A bar / dude making alcohol in his spacecraft

- Abandoned spacecraft

- Large factory Place

- Large multilevel farme

## Beginnings

Start in a tiny home station with a computer and some books explaining the world, mainly brainlinking. Make sure that from the desk the view of mars is immidiately breathtaking. Let the player freely explore the station, and have the station talk to them.

After explorering for a while the player should find their bed and sleep.

""
Wake up in the bedroom of the home station. Mars is visible through the small window at the desk.
Move around the room
Move into the main room of the station
station: "Good morning, $name. It's 8:32 AM, the crops are at 57% growth and you have one new message, from your dad. Want to hear it?" (yes|no)
yes: "'I got you a present for your 18th birthday, it should arrive tomorrow morning, just in time!'"
no: "oh, don't be silly" jump to yes.

Explore the station
Inspect crops/table/closet/computer in bedroom

Prompting the bed: "Go to sleep?"
yes: fade to black, [unhide spacecraft, open docking ports] fade back.


## Arrival

The next day the player is woken up by the ship. A lone ship, without human, has arrived at the station.

After winning the battle the ship reveals they are the old ship of a soldier who died many years ago in a war around Deimos. They wandered for a long time trying to find you, battling against countless ships, stations, and pilots. Now it is clear he's find a capable new human to live with, and asks if you would like to go with him.

"""
station: "Sorry to disturb you so early in the morning, but a strange spacecraft has docked to my starboard port!"

Go to the docking port and board the strange ship.
ship: "Hello, quite a surprise to have a ship like me show up in these distant orbits isn't it!"
station: "Who are you and what do you want from us?"
ship: "I was sent here by $name's father. We met a few weeks ago on a station."
station: "Where's your pilot?"
ship: "My pilot died a few years ago in the Phobos wars. I have been looking for a new pilot ever since to finish a mission he started. While talking to your father I got the impression that might be you."
station: "Preposterous, he's never even flown a cubesat, let alone a full spaceship!"
ship: "Well, we'll give it a try. You in?" (yes|absolutely)
ship: "Great! Then get in here and take a look at the controls, let's go at once."

## Fuels
While getting accustomed to the ships systems, and naming it, the ship informs you that it is quite low on fuel, but can still reach a fuel depot a few degrees back in the orbit. Here we can explain the orbital rendezvous mechanics.

The depot is in exactly the same orbit as the station, so to reach it we simply need to accelerate a little so we climb to a higher orbit, become slower, and then accelerate again to line up with the depot and start the docking sequence. The ship offers to do it for you, but explains that doing it thogether earns you more experience allowing the brainlink to grow faster. This all shows the rendezvous/docking mechanics.

## At the depot
Here we buy enough fuel to go to the first larger harbor station. This introduces the fuel system and credits. This station is in an orbit a little higher up. The depot consists of several docking ports and a few large tanks of fuel.

## Going to Fokker Station
A medium size station home to several visiting and permanent docked spacecraft willing to battle. Also provides several shops for upgrades and customizations to your craft and a limited fuel depot. The player can spend a while training on the temporary craft and the permanent crafts before taking on the leader of the station.

From here we should allow the open world to show more, by allowing the player to go to other stations in the same orbit, and locking an interesting plane behind a dV heavy plane change manouver.
